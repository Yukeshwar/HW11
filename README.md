# HW11
 
This project is a binary clock that uses 6 LEDs to show the seconds (0–59) in binary. Each LED stands for one bit, with LED1 being the least significant bit (LSB) and LED6 the most significant bit (MSB). The Arduino Uno updates the LEDs every second using the millis() function to calculate time. I've included a rough hand-drawn sketch of the circuit—let me know if that's okay or if I should make a neater version using schematic software
